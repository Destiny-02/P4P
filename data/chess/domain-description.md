THE CHESSBOARD IS YOUR KINGDOM
Chess was invented long ago. the names we use for the pieces date from the Middle Ages. In
those days kingdoms were ruled by Kings and Queens. They lived in castles and had
Bishops to advise them. They also had brave Knights to defend them. Even the peasants
helped to defend the kingdom.
 This is a chessboard.
It has alternating light and dark squares. All
chessboards have the same pattern of light
and dark squares. There are sixty four squares
in all on a chessboard.
A basic rule is that you must set up a
chessboard in a particular way when you start
to play.
Each player must have a light square in the
lower right corner.
REMEMBER: Light on the right!
Chess Notation
All new players should learn to keep score using what is called "algebraic"
notation. In the diagram above, you will notice that the board includes the
numbers 1-8 along the left edge and the letters "a" - "h" along the bottom the
board. We can use the combination of one letter and one number to describe
each square on the board. The square in the bottom left hand corner is called
“a1”. This is fully explained in detail on page 3 overleaf.

How To Read and Write Chess Moves
All new players should learn to keep score using what is called “algebraic” notation. In the diagram that follows,
you will notice that the board includes the numbers 1 - 8 along the right edge and the letters “a” - “h” along the
bottom of the board. We can use the combination of one letter and one number to describe each square on the
chessboard.
The important thing to remember is how to identify the pieces you are moving. You just need to use a single
capital letter: K: King Q: Queen R: Rook B: Bishop N: Knight
Note that “P” is not used. Chess players have agreed that a move without a letter - such as e4 - is understood to be
a pawn move.
You are almost ready to start using chess notation. Just pay attention to the following symbols:
X Take or capture # or ++ Checkmate
O-O Castles Kingside ! Good move
O-O-O Castles Queenside ? Bad move
+ Check ?? Blunder
Let’s put into practice what we’ve just learned. We will use the famous Scholar’s Mate”.
For example, the white King begins the game on e1. The
black Rooks begin the game on a8 and h8.
If I begin the game by pushing the pawn in front of the King
two squares, we can describe the move as e2-e4, or simply
e4. Moving the Knight on g1 to f3 would be written g1-f3 or
more simply Nf3.
An “x” is used to show that a capture has taken place. For
example, Nxe4 means that the Knight moves and captures
whatever was on e4.
You don’t necessarily need to include “check” in your
scoresheet, but you can easily do this with “ch” or just “+”.
For mate many players use “#”.
Remember:
It’s a good idea to
record your games so
that you can learn from
your mistakes when you
look at them later.

Chess Terms - Files, Ranks
and Diagonals
Files are the rows of squares that run up and down
the chessboard.

Ranks are the rows of squares that run across
the chessboard.
Diagonals are the rows of squares that run at a slant
on the chessboard.
Some simple rules regarding the chessmen:
Chessmen (pieces and pawns) can do either of two things:
1. They can move to vacant (empty) squares.
2. They can capture enemy chessmen.
Note the only piece that can never be captured is the King.
When an enemy chessman is taken, the piece or pawn that captures it takes its place on the
board.
More about Notation.
For example, the White King begins the game on e1. The Black Rooks begin the game on a8
and h8. If we begin the game by pushing the pawn in front of the White King two squares,
we can describe this move as e2-e4, or simply e4. Moving the Knight on g1 to f3 would be
written g1-f3, or more simply as Nf3. This will become clear later, don’t worry about it
now.
An "x" is used to show that a capture has taken place. For example, Nxe4 means that the

How the chessmen move.
At the start of the game White's pawns stand on the 2nd
rank, and Black's stand on the 7th rank as in our next
diagram.
 Each side has 8 Pawns
 This is their starting position
How the Pawn moves and captures
A pawn can move straight ahead one or two squares on its first move. After that, it can move
only one square at a time, even if it didn't go two squares on its first move.
The pawn, like the foot-soldier in war, marches forward one square at a time. Unlike the
other pieces, the pawn can NEVER retreat. Pawns that have not yet moved have the option
of beginning their forward journey with a double move two-squares forward. The pawns
may not jump other pieces or pawns.
The pawn captures differently from the way it moves.
The pawn captures diagonally one square ahead, as if it were
fighting on its side with a short sword. . .
In the first diagram, the white pawn can move to any of the squares
marked with an "X" By contrast, the black pawn, having already moved,
has only one option.
In the second diagram, the white pawn can move straight ahead, or else
capture the black Knight or the black Bishop. Meanwhile, the black
pawn is about to move to the end of the board. When a pawn reaches the
last
rank, it becomes another piece! In most situations, it will become a
Queen; you may not leave it as a pawn and you may not promote it into
a King. As a result of pawn promotion, it is possible to have many
Queens on the board at the same time, or other chosen pieces!
We assign a value to each chessman using the pawn as the lowest unit.
How to play chess Page 7
There is no chess rule concerning this, but it will make it easier to play a game if you have
some idea of the relative value of the chessmen, particularly when you need to make a
decision regarding exchanging one of your men for one of your opponent's.
 THE PAWN = 1
MORE ABOUT PAWNS
Pawns cannot jump over other pawns or pieces.
If blocked, a pawn can't move straight ahead until the other pawn
or piece gets out of the way.
In the diagram on the right the pawns block each other and
cannot move.
The Pawn in the diagram (right) can capture the Rook on the left,
or the Knight on the right.
The Bishop however, is immune from capture as the pawn may
only capture diagonally.
THE KNIGHT
Each side has 2 Knights How the Knight moves
Í This is their starting position

 In the diagram on the right Î
 the Knight may land on any
 square that has a dot.
The Knight moves in an “L” shape, two
squares forward and one to the side, or two squares sideways and one forward, or two square
backwards and one to the side. The Knight may jump over friendly and enemy pieces
without having any effect on the men it passes over.
The Knight captures any enemy piece or pawn it lands on.
We assign the Knight a notional value just as we did for the pawn.
 THE KNIGHT = 3 =
How to play chess Page 8
THE BISHOP
Each side has 2 Bishops How the Bishop moves

 In the diagram on the right Î
 the Bishop may land on any
 square that has an arrowhead
The Bishop moves diagonally (at a slant) stopping at any empty square, according to choice.
The Bishop may capture any enemy piece or pawn in its path.
We assign the Bishop a notional value just as we did for the Knight.

Í
 In the diagram on the right Î
 the Queen may land on any
 square that has an arrowhead
The Queen moves horizontally and vertically and diagonally stopping at any empty square,
according to choice. Another way to look at this is to say that the Queen combines the
powers of the Rook and bishop. The Queen may capture any enemy piece or pawn in its
path.
Note: At the start of each game the Queen stands on a square of her own colour - Black
Queen on a black square, White Queen on a white square.
We assign the Queen a notional value just as we did for the pawn.
 THE QUEEN = 9 =
Each side has 1 King. How the King moves
This is their starting position
Í
 In the diagram on the right Î
 the King may land on any
 square that has an arrowhead
The King moves only one square in any direction - horizontally,
vertically or diagonally. The King may capture any enemy piece or pawn in its path.
It is against the rules to move the King onto a square where it can be captured. If you do this
by accident, we say that the move is illegal. The illegal move must be taken back, and a legal
move must be played instead.
OPPOSITION - The Kings must stay apart.
Enemy Kings can never get close enough to capture each other.
There must always be at least one square between Kings.
This can be seen in the diagram (right). Î
Neither King can move to a square marked with an “X”.
They oppose each other at one squares distance.
This situation is known as "The opposition".
How to play chess Page 10
Whenever the King is attacked we say that he is “in check”. The rules require that the King
gets out of check on the very next move. Since the King is not allowed to be captured, it is
an infinitely valuable piece and cannot therefore be given a numerical value.
SPECIAL MOVES -
CHECK, CHECKMATE & STALEMATE
In the first diagram below the White King is attacked by the black bishop.
An attack on the King has a special
name. It is called CHECK.
When the King is under attack we say
the King is in check. When the King is in
check, it must be saved immediately.
The King can never be captured or
exchanged for another piece. If the King
cannot be saved, the game is over. If
your King is in check you cannot make
any other move until you deal with the
check right away.
There are three ways to answer a check
 • Move the King to a safe square (Escape) - in this case the King could move to f1 or e2.
 • Capture the attacking piece (Remove the attacker) - in this case the White Queen could
 capture the Bishop.
 • Place another man in the line of fire (Block the check) - in this case the Knight could move
 to d2.
As all the legal ways of answering check are available in the diagram above, White may
choose the method he thinks is best.
Okay, we now know almost all the rules.
As soon as we cover a few more important points we will look at a real game.
How to play chess Page 11
SPECIAL MOVES - CASTLING
Once the battle commences the Kings need a safe home. The rules allow for a special move
that safeguards the King. This is called castling. There are strict rules regarding when and
how castling may take place. First we will illustrate the castling manoeuvre. When the Kings
castle it is the only time in the chess game that two pieces may move at the same time. It is
also the only time that the King can move more than one square at a time. It is also the only
time a Rook may jump over another piece.
Before Castling Kingside After Castling Kingside
Before Castling Queenside After Castling Qeenside
CASTLING RULES
There are a number of rules that must be observed concerning castling.
•Being in check stops you castling. You cannot castle if you are in check.
•You must get out of check first, then you may be able to castle later on.
•The King cannot cross a square controlled by an enemy man in order to castle.
•The King cannot move onto a square controlled by an enemy man when castling.
•You cannot castle if there are pieces between the King and the Rook.
•The King and the Rook to be used in castling must not have moved earlier in the game.
How to play chess Page 12
Our diagram opposite shows a number of these possibilities.
White cannot castle on the Kingside, since that would place his
King in check from the Queen on g6.
He may castle on the Queenside, since the King does not move
across a check, even though the Rook on a1 crosses a square
which is attacked by the Black Queen.
Beginners are often confused, and think that you may not castle if you have ever been in
check. This is quite wrong - as long as you have not moved your King it does not matter how
many times you have been in check earlier in the game.
Remember this special rule about Kings: They can never allow themselves to be captured.
SPECIAL MOVES
PAWN PROMOTION Sometimes referred to as "Queening"
When a Pawn reaches the last rank it can become any piece other than a King. It cannot
remain as a Pawn, but must take on a new role. It can become a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or
Knight. You can have a new Queen even though you still have the original Queen on the
board, and you can continue this process if you succeed in promoting more pawns.
Our first diagram below, shows a White pawn at b7, about to "Queen" at b8. In our second
diagram below, The pawn has been "promoted". The pawn has advanced and White has
chosen a new Queen, which replaces the pawn.


 BEFORE QUEENING AFTER QUEENING
We call it "Queening", since nearly always a player will change the promoted pawn into a
 new Queen, because the Queen is the most powerful piece.
Important note:
You may legally have many Queens or indeed, other pieces.
How to play chess Page 13
CAPTURING "En Passant" Pronounced "On-Pass-on"
The "En Passant" rule
 Before Black’s pawn advances White has captured “en passant”
En passant is a French term meaning "in passing". It is Black's move in the diagram above
(left). He has the option of advancing the pawn one square or two, as the pawn has not yet
moved. It is reasonable to assume that if Black moves the pawn two squares he will avoid
capture. However, White may capture it anyway. The en passant rule allows White to
capture the pawn as if it had only moved one square ahead. This means that whether Black's
pawn moves one square or two, it can be captured by White on the very same square.
It is a requirement of the rules that the "en passant" capture (if used) must be carried out
right away. It cannot be deferred, or the right to play it is forfeited.
The diagram on the right above shows the position as White carries out the "en passant"
manoeuvre. White removes the Black pawn from d5 and places his own pawn on d6.
Making the en passant capture is not compulsory
Capturing "En Passant" Further Explanation
This is one of the trickiest moves to learn and the single move that causes consternation
among beginners. A small bit of history helps to introduce and to understand the en passant
(French for "in passing") capture. During the early days of chess, pawns could only move a
single square at a time. Several changes were introduced in Europe to speed up the game.
One of these changes permitted pawns to move two squares if they had not yet moved.
But this rule change introduced an unfortunate situation. A pawn could now move all the
way down the board to become a queen without the opponent's pawn ever having a chance to
capture it. When the Black pawn moves forward two squares in a single move, the White
pawn on the neighbouring file wants to be able to capture the pawn before the black pawn
can advance further. The en passant rule applies here.
For one move, AND ONE MOVE ONLY, the White pawn can respond by capturing the
Black pawn as if it had only moved a single square.
Note that only pawns can capture "en passant," and only a pawn on an adjacent file can
capture in this way.

DRAWING THE GAME
Stalemate
If the King is not in check, but cannot move without moving into check, and the player
cannot move any other piece or pawn, then it is stalemate. This is regarded as a draw in
spite of any material difference between the two sides. In the position below it is Black's
turn to move, but his only piece cannot make a legal
move. It is stalemate.
Perpetual Check
If a player is unable to escape from annoying checks at each consecutive move,
even though he has far more men than the opponent then it is a draw.
We call this Perpetual Check.
Let's see this in action below.
In the position shown in the first diagram below, the White Queen would not normally be
able to cope with all the Black forces. But this is an exceptional case.
White moves the
Queen to g5
“checking” the King.
Black must move the
King.
The King goes to h8. The Queen returns to
f6 “checking” the
King.
The King returns to
g8 and we have
arrived back at the
same position as the
first diagram.
How to play chess Page 15
White draws easily by repeating this process. Black is powerless to avoid this as his King is exposed and his
pieces cannot prevent the checks.
Insufficient Material
It is also a draw if neither player has enough men to checkmate the opponent, as in the
diagram , where a King and Bishop cannot deliver
checkmate without the help of other forces.
Another draw is by agreement. If both players say it is a
draw, then it is a draw.
Finally, if the exact same position is reached three times in
one chess game, a draw can be claimed. The exact same
position does not have to happen three times in a row.
However, it must be the same player's turn to move.
This rarely arises.
Time To Examine a Real Game
Note that at the start of the game, the only pieces,
apart from pawns that may enter the fray are the
Knights, since they are the only pieces that can
jump over other pieces or pawns. Note also that the
best location for our pieces is in or near the centre.
We regard the centre to be the complex of squares
highlighted in the diagram. It is important to exert
some influence over these squares, for reasons that
will be apparent later.
We give the moves in bold type, followed by an explanation
1.e4
White plays his e-pawn to e4. From here it
"controls" or at least has an influence over two
important central squares.
At the same time it enables his Queen and Bishop
to enter the game when required.
How to play chess Page 16
1...Nc6
While this move is not a mistake here, it is better
to place a pawn in the centre.
It is best to play according to the three
Golden Principles of Opening Play, namely:
1. Place a pawn in the centre and maintain it there.
2. Develop your pieces towards the centre.
3. Look after your King's safety. This is best done
by castling.
2.d4
This is an excellent move, exerting more
influence on the centre, and enabling the dark
squared Bishop to come into play.
2...e5
A reasonable move, advancing in the centre and
releasing the Bishop and Queen.
How to play chess Page 17
3.d5
White advances in the centre, attacking the Knight
at the same time. We know that a pawn has a
notional value of one point and a Knight is worth
three, so the Knight must move or be lost.
3...Nce7
Black moves the Knight to safety.
Note that as the knight at g7 could also move to
this square (e7), we describe the move precisely -
the Knight from c6 moves to e7.
4.f4
With this move White attacks the pawn at e5.
Black could capture the White pawn at f4 but this
would give up his influence on the centre. He
therefore decides to defend the pawn while at the
same time preparing to develop his light squared
Bishop.
How to play chess Page 18
4...d6
Black defends the pawn at e5 and at the same
time prepares to bring the Bishop at c8 into play.
5.Nf3
White "develops" his Knight, adding pressure on
the central squares and gets one move closer to
castling.
5...Bg4
An instructive move.
Black reduces the effectiveness of the White
Knight at f3 by "pinning" it against the White
Queen. Note that if the Knight moves from f3
then the Queen at d1 would be lost. This is
illustrated by the arrow. Remember, a Bishop is
worth 3 points and a Queen is worth 9 points. If
White moves the Knight at f3, he had better have
a good reason!
How to play chess Page 19
6.Nc3
 White makes no specific or immediate threat with
this move. He is mobilising his forces, or as we
say in chess, he is developing his pieces.
6...Ng6
The White pawn at f4 is now attacked twice, and
defended only once (by the Bishop at c1).
7.h3
As in war, the counter-attack is frequently used in
chess. Instead of guarding his threatened pawn,
White makes a counter-threat which cannot be
ignored without loss, a Bishop being worth more
than a pawn.
How to play chess Page 20
7...Bxf3
The White Knight is removed from the board and
the Black Bishop occupies the square on which the
Knight stood. Black now threatens to capture the
White Queen on his next move.Note that the "x"
in chess notation stands for "takes" or "captures".
8.Bb5+
White moves his Bishop to a square on which it
attacks the King. The White player calls out
"check!" Black MUST drop everything and get
his King out of check. A check is the most
effective of all counter-attacks - one which MUST
be answered. White can leave his Queen open to
capture because he knows that Black is not
allowed to capture it while his King is in check.
Note that the plus (+) sign is used to denote check.
8...c6
Black chose to block the check, rather than move
his King, as he would like to retain the option of
castling later.
How to play chess Page 21
9.dxc6!!
White captures the pawn at c6 with his d-pawn!
Has he forgotten that his Queen is attacked by the
Black Bishop?
Please note: we use exclamation marks to indicate
a good move.
9...Bxd1?
Actually, White has not made a mistake. He has
planned ahead and knows that if Black takes the
Queen, he will win the game. This is an example
of a "combination".
Please note: we use a question mark to indicate a
bad or ill-considered move.
10.cxb7+
This is a "discovered" check. The attack on the
King was unmasked by capturing with the White
pawn which stood between the Bishop and the
King.
How to play chess Page 22
10...Ke7
Black moves the King out of check, rather than
blocking the check with his Queen.
11.Nd5+
White is closing in for the kill. His Knight leaps to the
attack and forces the enemy King to come forward
and meet his doom. Having "sacrificed" his Queen,
the most valuable of all the pieces, White must make
forceful moves and give his opponent's King no
opportunity to escape. Black now realises that the
capture of the Queen was a mistake. This capture
made it possible for White to launch an attack on the
Black King.
Now Black has only one legal move. Can you see it?
11...Ke6
This move was "forced".
When a Knight gives check, The Knight must be
captured or the King must move, since a Knight's
attack cannot be blocked. Examine this position
carefully and see if you can select White's next move.
Note that Black's King is hemmed in by White's
forces. The King cannot move to a vacant square as he
would be moving into check. For the same reason, he
cannot capture the Knight. White can now deliver the
final blow.
12.f5# It’s Checkmate.
Black cannot capture the pawn at f5, nor the Knight at
d5 as they are both protected by the White pawn at e4.
The flight squares at e7 and f6 are controlled by the
White Knight and the square d7 is controlled by the
White Bishop at b5. 
1. Pawns should fill the
second ranks (rows) of each
side of your board.
2. Rooks are placed in the
corners, just like towers on a
real castle.
3. Moving one file (column)
inward, knights (the horses)
go next to the rooks.
4. Bishops go between the
knights and your royalty, the
king and queen.
5. The queen goes on her
own colored square.
6. The king goes on the last
available square.
PLACING THE PIECES
THE ULTIMATE CHES S
CHEAT SHEET
Before placing the pieces, it’s important to start with the
proper orientation of the board. No matter which side of the
board you’re on, the bottom right square should be white.
Setting Up the Board
BOARD ORIENTATION
Playing the Game
The player with the white pieces always makes the first move. After
that, the players take turns making moves until the game ends. You
may move your pieces to any square that is either unoccupied or
occupied by an opponent’s piece. When you move to an occupied
square you capture that opposing piece and remove it from the board.
MAKING MOVES
Before you begin to play, it is important to decide how much time each player receives to play the
entire game and if any time will be added to the clock after each move (increment). If a player
runs out of time before making their move, they automatically lose the game.

CHECK
When a king is attacked, it is called check. Check is like saying, "Watch
out! The king is attacked!" Since a king can never be captured, the term
"check" is used when a king is threatened. If a player is in check, they
must get out of check!
THERE ARE 3 WAYS TO GET OUT OF CHECK:
1. Move the king out of
check.
2. Block the check with
another piece.
3. Capture the piece putting
the king in check.

CHECKMATE
Checkmating your opponent is
the most crucial goal in chess.
A checkmate occurs when a king is
placed in check and has no legal
moves to escape. When a
checkmate happens, the game
ends immediately, and the player
who delivered the checkmate wins.
INSUFFICIENT MATERIAL
If there are not enough pieces on the board to force a
checkmate, i.e. only two kings left, or if one player runs out of
time but the other does not have the pieces left to produce a
checkmate, the game is drawn.
STALEMATE
When the player who has to move has no legal moves
available, the game ends immediately in a tie by stalemate.
THREEFOLD REPETITION
If the same exact position is repeated three times (though not
necessarily three times in a row) the game is drawn. A position
is repeated if all pieces of the same kind and color are on
identical squares, and all possible moves are the same.
FIFTY MOVE RULE
If fifty consecutive moves (one move being when both players
have taken a turn) have been played where neither player has
moved a pawn or captured a piece, the game ends in a draw.
DRAW BY AGREEMENT
Both players agree to end the game in a draw.
4 Ending the Game Every chess game ends in one of three results:
a win for White, a win for Black, or a draw.
There are 3 common ways
to win a game of chess.
1. Checkmate. Your opponent’s
 king has nowhere to run.
2. Resignation. Your opponent
 gives up.
3. Flagging. Your opponent
 runs out of time.
There are several ways for
the game to end in a draw:

5 Unique Pawn Moves
1. The black pawn moves
two squares for its first
move, landing right next to
the white pawn.
2. On the next move, the
white pawn captures the
black pawn as if it had only
advanced one square.
3. The white pawn lands on
the square directly behind
the black pawn and the
black pawn is captured.
EN PASSANT
The en passant rule is a special pawn capturing move in chess. Normally, pawns can only capture
pieces that are directly and diagonally in front of them on an adjacent file (column). With en
passant, though, things are a little different. This type of capture is the only one in chess where
the capturing piece doesn't land on the same square as its victim. Here is an example of an en
passant capture for White, but know that colors may be reversed.
PAWN PROMOTION
Promoting a pawn is one of the main goals of
chess during an endgame. Pawn promotion
occurs when a pawn reaches the farthest
rank from its original square. When this
happens, the player can replace the pawn for a
queen, a rook, a bishop, or a knight. Most of the
time, players promote a pawn to a queen, which
is popularly known as "queening the pawn."
After one player promotes a pawn, the other player has to move (unless they are checkmated).
There's no limit regarding the number of active pieces of the same kind on the board.
UNDERPROMOTION is when the player promoting a pawn turns it into any piece other
than a queen. This is usually done to avoid stalemate or to checkmate the king with a knight.

6 Castling
3. If you are in
check, you cannot
castle. You must
first get out of
check before you
can castle.
4. You cannot
castle if any
square the king is
moving through is
attacked by your
opponent's
pieces.
Note: you can still
castle if the rook is
moving through an
attacked square or if
it’s being attacked.
5. You cannot
castle into check.
This makes sense
since moving into
check is illegal in
the first place!
KINGSIDE CASTLE: The white king moves
two squares to the right (the black king moves
two squares to the left), and the white rook
jumps over the king and lands on the square
right next to it. On Chess.com, you can castle by
dragging your king from its starting square and
dropping it two squares to its right (or left if
you’re playing Black).
QUEENSIDE CASTLE: The white king moves
two squares to the left (the black king moves two
squares to the right), and the white rook jumps
over the king and lands on the square right next
to it. On Chess.com, you castle by dragging your
king from its starting square and dropping it two
square to its left (or right if you’re playing Black).
Castling is a special defensive move that protects your king and brings your rook into the game.
Castling is the only move where you may move two pieces simultaneously. Castling is also the
only time in chess when it is legal to move the king more than one square. Castling can be
performed with either the kingside or queenside rook.
1. You may only castle if you haven't
moved your king or your rook.
2. No piece can be between your king
and the rook on the side where you want
to castle.

7 Basic Chess Concepts
Now that you know all the rules of the royal game, it’s time to learn a few
key concepts that will help you win more games. Here are some of the
most important things you need to know:
PROTECT YOUR KING
Protecting your king (and attacking your opponent’s king) is the most
critical aspect of chess. Protecting your king should be your top
priority—if you get checkmated, you lose the game even if you have more
pieces. That’s why you should always try to castle as fast as possible at the
start of the game. When you castle, your king moves to one of the sides
of the board where less of your opponent’s pieces will be able to reach it.
Castling also brings one of your rooks closer to the center of the board,
from where it will be able to help in your attacking and defensive efforts.
CONTROL THE CENTER
The central squares in the middle of the board are the most important
on the chessboard. When playing chess, one of your priorities should be
trying to control the center by having the most pawns and pieces
attacking those squares. The player who controls the center has more
options to attack, make threats, and move their pieces around the board.
Note that the value assigned to each piece is just a tool to remind you of how strong the piece is. In chess, you
don’t really win a game by simply having more material points—you have to be able to checkmate your opponent.
KNOW THE VALUE OF EACH PIECE
In chess, different pieces have different values based on how powerful they are.
Knowing the value of the pieces is important to know when you should trade one piece
for another. If you trade a piece of lesser value for one of your opponent’s better pieces,
you’ll have a material advantage and it will be easier for you to attack and defend.
DEVELOP YOUR PIECES
Developing your pieces means moving them off of their starting squares to more active, strategic
squares. The more pieces you develop, the more you can use the full power of your army. It’s
usually a good idea to develop your minor pieces (knights and bishops) first, castle, and only then
develop your remaining major pieces (the other rook and the queen). It’s also a good idea to avoid
moving the same piece more than once in the opening unless you need to move it to avoid losing
it. It’s also important to avoid making too many pawn moves before you develop all your pieces.

8 Win with Tactics
Now that you’re familiar with the most important strategical
concepts of chess, it’s time for you to learn how to use tactics
to win games. A tactic is a maneuver that a player can make
to seize an immediate opportunity, such as material gain or
checkmate. Here are the most common tactics in chess:
PINS
Pins happen when a piece
attacks an opponent's piece
aligned with another more
valuable piece or critical
square. The attacked piece is
then "pinned" to the board
since moving it would cause
the attacked player to suffer a
significant loss.
SKEWERS
Skewers are like backward
pins. They happen when a
piece attacks a more valuable
piece that is aligned with a
weaker piece. The more
valuable piece has to move
and allow the attacker to
capture the piece behind it.
FORKS
Forks happen when a single
piece attacks two or more
pieces simultaneously with
no way for at least one of
them to escape. Knights are
especially useful for forking
because of their unique
movement.
DISCOVERED
ATTACK
A discovered attack
happens when a player
moves one piece which
reveals an attack from a
different piece. If the
uncovered piece attacks
the enemy king, it’s called
a discovered check.

How the Pieces Move
• If it is a pawn's first move, it can
 move forward one or two squares.
• After the first move, it can move
 forward just one square at a time.
• It attacks (or captures) each square
 diagonally to the left or right.
THE PAWN
The knight is the only piece
in chess that can jump over
another piece! It moves in an
"L-shape."
THE KNIGHT
The bishop can move diagonally
as many squares as it likes.
Therefore, each bishop only moves
on squares of the same color as
the one it starts on.
THE BISHOP
The rook can move as many
squares as it likes horizontally
or vertically as long as it is not
blocked by an occupied square.
THE ROOK
Learn more: chess.com/terms/chess-pieces
The queen is the most
powerful piece. The
queen can move like a
rook or like a bishop.
THE QUEEN
The king is the most
important piece.
However, it can only
move one square at a
time, in any direction
it wants.

Chess is a game for two players. One
player controls the white pieces and the
other player controls the black pieces.
Traditionally, players start the game by
shaking hands with their opponent. White
always moves first and then players take
turns (white then black then white, etc). Turns consist of moving a
piece from one square to another square (as described in topics 4 - 9).
A player may capture an opponent’s piece by moving their piece to
the square the opponent’s piece occupies, in doing so, removing the
opponent’s piece and setting it on the side of the board. A player may
never capture their own piece. The goal of the game is to checkmate
an opponent's King (as explained in Topic 11).
The chess board is a checkered
board made up of eight vertical
columns, called files, and eight
horizontal rows, called ranks. This
creates 64 squares, both light and
dark. Every rank and file has a name.
The a - file, b - file, c - file, etc. The
1st rank, 2nd rank, etc. This gives
every square a name listed by letter
and number (eg. b3, d7, g5, h1) Ref:
[Figure 2.1]. The chessboard must be set
up so that both players have a white
square on their right hand corner.

Topic 3: The Pieces
There are six different types of chess
pieces: King, Queen, Rook, Bishop,
Knight, and Pawn. The chess set
contains pieces of two different
colors, one light and one dark, called
White and Black. The board is set
up as shown [Ref: Figure 3.1]. The white
pieces begin on the 1st and 2nd ranks
and the black pieces begin on the
7th and 8th ranks. The white Queen
begins on a light square and the
black queen begins on a dark square.
Each piece has a relative point value based on its mobility.
Understanding these point values allows a player to evaluate whether
exchanging pieces is a good or bad idea; however, point values have
no direct impact on the result of a game. See topic 11 for how to win
a chess game.

Topic 4: The King
Since the object of the game is to checkmate the King, it is the most
important piece in the game of chess. The King moves one square
in any direction. The King captures in the same way that it moves
(moving the King one square to the square that the opponent’s pieces
occupies and then removing the opponent’s piece) [Ref: Figures 4.1 & 4.2].
The King may never move into or through danger and the King may
never be removed from the board. If a player makes a move that
leaves or puts their King in danger, this is an illegal move. It must be
taken back and a legal move must be played. The white King begins
the game on e1 and the black King begins the game on e8.

Topic 5: The Rook
The Rook (sometimes incorrectly called a castle) moves up, down,
left, or right, 1 - 7 squares in any direction until the Rook reaches an
obstruction or captures a piece (the Rook cannot jump over pieces and
can only capture one piece per turn) [Ref: Figures 5.1 & 5.2]. The white Rooks
begin the game in the corners, a1 and h1. The black Rooks begin in the
corners, a8 and h8. The Rook has a piece value of 5 points.

Topic 6: The Bishop
The Bishop only moves diagonally. The Bishop may move 1-7 squares
in any diagonal direction [Ref: Figure 6.1]. The Bishop cannot jump over
pieces and can only capture one piece per turn [Ref: Figure 6.2]. Because
the Bishop moves diagonally, it may never move to a different color
other than the one it starts on. Each player has a light-squared Bishop
and a dark-squared Bishop. The white Bishops begin on c1 and f1.
The black Bishops begin on c8 and f8. The Bishop has a piece value
of 3 points.

Topic 7: The Queen
The Queen is the most powerful piece in the game of chess. The
Queen can move 1-7 squares in any direction, up, down, left, right, or
diagonal, until the Queen reaches an obstruction or captures a piece;
however, the Queen cannot jump over pieces and can only capture
one piece per turn [Ref: Figure 7.1 & 7.2]. The white Queen begins the game
on d1 and the black Queen on d8. The Queen has a piece value of 9
points.

Topic 8: The Knight
The Knight moves in a direction described as an “L”. The Knight, from
a starting square, moves 2 squares, up, down, left, or right, and then
one square at a right angle, forming an “L” [Ref: Figure 8.1 & 8.2]. The Knight
is the only piece that may jump over other pieces but only captures the
piece of the square that he lands on (not the pieces he jumps over).
The white Knights begin the game on b1 and g1. The black Knights
begin on b8 and g8. The Knight has a piece value of 3 points (equal
to the Bishop). NOTE: EVERY move the Knight makes ALWAYS changes the color
of the square that it stands on.

Topic 9: The Pawns
The Pawn moves directly forward [Ref: Figure 9.1], never backward or to
the side. Pawns move exactly one square forward; though each Pawn
may advance two squares forward the first time it is moved. Pawns
capture a piece that is one square diagonally forward [Ref: Figure 9.2].
Though Pawns normally cannot move diagonally, this is the only way
they capture. Pawns are the only piece that capture differently than
they move. The white Pawns begin on the 2nd rank and the black
Pawns begin on the 7th rank. The Pawn has a piece value of 1 point.

Topic 10: Pawn Promotion
Pawns are the only piece in chess that may promote. Promotion
occurs when the Pawn reaches the opposite side of the board (1st rank
for black, 8th rank for white). In the same turn, the Pawn is removed
from the board and is replaced with an extra piece of the promoting
player’s choice [Ref: Figure 10.1 & 10.2], (Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight)
even if these pieces are already on the board. This concludes the
player’s turn.

Topic 11: Checkmate
Checkmate immediately ends the game (the King is never removed
from the board) and players shake
hands to agree. Checkmate is
the goal of the game of chess.
Checkmate is when one player
puts the opponent’s King in danger
(called “check”) and the opponent
can do nothing with their King or
any other pieces to stop the King
from being in danger [Ref: Figure 11.1 &
11.2] (run away with the King, capture
the checking piece, or use another
piece to block.) [Ref: Figure 11.3] A B C D E F G H

Topic 12: Castling
Castling is a special move to make the King safer. In one turn, the
King moves two squares towards one Rook and that Rook jumps over
the King, landing next to the King. [Ref: Figure 13.1 &13.2]
Rules for Castling:
The King cannot castle if either the King or the Rook
involved have already moved in that game.
There can be no pieces between the King and the Rook.
The King cannot castle while in check. [Ref: Figure 13.3]
The King cannot castle into or through check. [Ref: Figure 13.4]
The King can never “un-castle”.

Topic 13: En Passant
En Passant is a special Pawn move. If a Pawn steps forward two
squares, landing adjacent to an opponent’s Pawn, the opponent’s
Pawn may capture as though it moved only one square. The En
Passant capture may only take place after a Pawn moves two squares
and only on the move immediately following. [Ref: Figures 12.1 & 12.2]

Topic 14: Draws
A Draw is when neither player wins or loses. There are several types of
draws in chess. Some common ways that a draw can occur are:
Stalemate
Stalemate occurs when a player has no
possible legal moves on their turn and
their King is not in check [Ref: Figure 14.1 &
14.2].
Insufficient Material
Insufficient material occurs when
neither player has adequate pieces left
on the board to achieve a checkmate
[Ref: Figure 14.3 & 14.4].
Offered Draw
A draw can be achieved by one player
offering a draw to his opponent. His
opponent can then choose to either
accept or decline the draw.
Threefold Repetition
A draw is achieved through Threefold
Repetition when the same position
occurs three times in a single game.
The repeated position does not need to
occur in succession.
