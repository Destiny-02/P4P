This file provides general information describing the population this dataset
is a sample of.

LANGUAGE
Java.

FUNCTIONALITY
Each design a simple payroll system. The file ugrad009-01.html contains a
modified version of the assignment requirements for the assignment submissions
in the ugrad009-01 corpus. The modifications made are mainly to support
de-identification of the submissions, but also remove unnecessary details
(e.g. due dates, specifics regarding submission, specific assessment
criteria), and and minor corrections to the text.

CORRECTNESS
Most submissions were considered correct. However, no information for
individual submissions is available.

CONTEXT 
Assignment for an undergraduate course, which is the first course
teaching object-oriented programming. The assignment was the first
requiring students to demonstrate their understanding of object-oriented
design. The only criteria was to demonstrate this understanding (so
there was not, for example, requirements for use of polymophism,
inheritance, or sophisticated features of Java).
