# Sample Documentation

This is a sample markdown file, which serves as documentation for SAAAP (Sample Acronym and Abbreviation Parser).

Some abbreivations are less straightforward, like COM (communication port) or starboard (STBD).

It's even more complicated when the full phrase is introduced within a body of prose, for example, the phase Software Engineering (SOFTENG) or Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT).

Abbreviations might also exist in lists:

- VTS: Vessel Traffic Services
- AIS ( Automatic Identification System )
- UTC: Universal Coordinated Time
- European Train Control System (ETCS)
- COSPAS-SARSAT (Cosmicheskaya Sistema Poiska Avariynyh Sudov - Search And Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking)
