# Identifier Categorisation

This function processes each identifier, and categorises them based on the `design`/`context`/`neither` lists generated by previous steps.

For the `neither` words, this script runs various validators on each suspicious word in the identifier. These validators live in the [./validators](./validators) folder.

The validators detect obvious issues and can suggest improvements.

**Usage:**

- Run `python -m src.categoriseIdentifiers DOMAIN_NAME"`, where `DOMAIN_NAME` is the domain name.
- If you only want to analyse one repository from the domain, add the CLI flag `-r REPO_NAME`
- If you want the list of meaningful and non-meaningful identifier classifications, add the CLI flag `--list`
- Like all scripts, the `--cache` flag is optional and will bypass the slow parser
- The slowest checks are not run by default, you need to add `--slow` to generate these diagnostics.

Results are saved to the `output/` folder.
