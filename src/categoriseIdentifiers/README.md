# Identifier Categorisation

This function processes each identifier, and categorises them based on the `design`/`context`/`neither` lists generated by previous steps.

For the `neither` words, this script runs various validators on each suspicious word in the identifier. These validators live in the [./validators](./validators) folder.

The validators detect obvious issues and can suggest improvements.

**Usage:**

- Run `python src/categoriseIdentifiers/categoriseIdentifiers.py --cache "ugrad-009-01/design1000"`, where `ugrad-009-01` is the domain name and `design1000` is the repo name.
- Like all scripts, the `--cache` flag is optional and will bypass the slow parser

Results are saved to `design1000.json` (depending on the chosen repo) in the folder where the script is run.
